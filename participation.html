        <h2>American Spaces Volunteer Program (ASVP)</h2>
            <p>The American Spaces Volunteer Program (ASVP) in Ethiopia, initiated by the U.S. Embassy in Addis Ababa, engages young Ethiopian leaders in volunteerism and community service. 
                This initiative provides opportunities for volunteers to lead programs in various fields, including life skills, the environment, Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM), and more. 
                The program encourages public engagement and fosters a sense of responsibility among participants, which aligns with the core democratic values of volunteerism and community service.

                In 2018, over 50 volunteers offered free sessions to more than 500 participants across different American Spaces in cities like Addis Ababa, Bahir Dar, Jimma, and Dire Dawa. 
                The program covers diverse topics, such as art, photography, programming languages like C++, and even 3D design, aiming to build capacity in local communities. 
                Volunteers also receive certificates of recognition for their contributions, reinforcing the spirit of civic engagement and personal growth​(US Embassy)​(US Embassy).
