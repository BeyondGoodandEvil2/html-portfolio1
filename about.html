    <h2>About ME</h2>
    <p>
        Hi my name is Amanuel Omude, I am a student studying Electrical Engineering at AASTU (Addis Ababa Science and Technology University) in Ethiopia, Addis Ababa. 
        Even though Iâ€™m learning Electrical Engineering, I always had a passion for software programming, I was always eager to learn new skills that allow me to create something that 
        I can use and share to other people. With a strong foundation in web-development, I'm eager to apply my academic knowledge to real-world challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
        Through online courses and tutoring, I've developed foundation for programming in HTML, CSS, JS, and Python as well. 
        I'm seeking opportunities to learn and grow, and I'm excited to connect with professionals in these fields.
